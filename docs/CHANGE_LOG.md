## [2025-06-09 11:20:00] - MAJOR

**Modified Files:**
- `src/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql` - Complete PostgreSQL database schema
- `src/models/User.js` - User model with authentication methods
- `src/models/BankConnection.js` - Bank connection model with encrypted token storage
- `src/models/BankAccount.js` - Bank account model with balance tracking
- `src/models/Transaction.js` - Transaction model with filtering and analysis
- `src/utils/migrationRunner.js` - Database migration system
- `scripts/setup-database.js` - Database setup automation script
- `src/services/powens/powensService.js` - Complete Powens API integration
- `src/routes/auth.js` - Real Powens OAuth implementation
- `src/routes/sync.js` - Real data synchronization from Powens

**Change Description:**
Implemented complete real Powens integration with comprehensive database schema and models. Replaced all mock data functionality with real banking API integration, secure token storage, and automated data synchronization.

**Reasoning:**
User requested transition from mock data to real Powens banking data with proper database structure. This implementation provides a production-ready foundation for storing and managing real banking connections, accounts, transactions, user preferences, and session management.

**Potential Impacts:**
- Database: Complete schema with 9 core tables, proper relationships, and indexes
- API: Real Powens OAuth flow and data synchronization
- Security: Encrypted token storage, secure session management
- Data: Real banking data storage and management
- Models: Full ORM-style models for all entities
- Migration: Automated database setup and versioning system

**Testing Notes:**
1. Run database setup: `node scripts/setup-database.js`
2. Configure Powens credentials in .env file
3. Test OAuth flow: GET /api/auth/powens/url
4. Complete bank connection via returned authorization URL
5. Test data sync: POST /api/sync/full
6. Verify real data: GET /api/accounts and GET /api/transactions
7. Check sync status: GET /api/sync/status

**Environment Variables Required:**
- POWENS_CLIENT_ID: Your Powens application client ID
- POWENS_CLIENT_SECRET: Your Powens application secret
- POWENS_REDIRECT_URI: OAuth callback URL
- ENCRYPTION_KEY: 32-character key for token encryption
- Database credentials: DB_HOST, DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD

## [2025-06-09 11:01:00] - CRITICAL

**Modified Files:**
- `src/public/index.html` - CRITICAL FIX: Resolved CSP violation preventing button functionality

**Change Description:**
Fixed the root cause of non-functional dashboard buttons: Content Security Policy (CSP) was blocking inline `onclick` event handlers. Completely refactored frontend JavaScript to use CSP-compliant event listeners with data-action attributes.

**Reasoning:**
User reported buttons were completely non-functional despite API endpoints being correct. Browser console revealed CSP error: "Refused to execute inline event handler because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: 'script-src-attr 'none'". This security policy blocks inline JavaScript execution, requiring proper event listener approach.

**Potential Impacts:**
- Frontend: ALL buttons now functional and CSP-compliant
- Security: Improved security posture by using proper event listeners
- Debugging: Enhanced logging throughout frontend for better troubleshooting
- User Experience: Dashboard now fully interactive and responsive

**Testing Notes:**
- Refresh browser and test all buttons - should now work without CSP errors
- Check browser console (F12) - should see "ðŸ”¥ FIRE Planning Dashboard - JavaScript loaded" and button click logs
- Click "Initialize Connection" - should show mock Powens response in display area
- All sync, health, and account buttons should now execute properly
- No more CSP violations in browser console

**Agent:** Claude-4-Sonnet
**Request ID:** CSP_FIX_001

## [2025-06-09 10:52:00] - MAJOR

**Modified Files:**
- `src/public/index.html` - Fixed frontend button functionality by correcting API endpoint mappings

**Change Description:**
Fixed critical issue where dashboard buttons were non-functional due to incorrect API endpoint URLs. Corrected health check endpoint, sync endpoint mappings, and improved error handling with better logging.

**Reasoning:**
Frontend JavaScript was calling incorrect API endpoints that didn't match the server route structure. Health check was calling '/../health' instead of '/health', and sync endpoints were mapped incorrectly (e.g., '/accounts/sync' instead of '/sync/accounts').

**Potential Impacts:**
- Frontend: All dashboard buttons now functional
- API: Proper endpoint communication established
- Debugging: Enhanced logging for troubleshooting
- User Experience: Dashboard now fully interactive

**Testing Notes:**
- Click "Initialize Connection" button - should show mock response
- Click "Check Health" - should show server status and update connection indicator
- Click "Sync Accounts/Transactions/Full Sync" - should show mock sync responses
- Check browser console for detailed API call logs
- Verify all buttons display responses in their respective sections

**Agent:** Claude-4-Sonnet
**Request ID:** BUTTON_FIX_001

## [2025-06-09 10:40:00] - MINOR

**Modified Files:**
- `src/server.js` - Fixed logger import by destructuring from utils/logger module

**Change Description:**
Fixed TypeError: logger.error is not a function by correcting the import statement from `const logger = require('./utils/logger')` to `const { logger } = require('./utils/logger')`.

**Reasoning:**
The utils/logger.js module exports an object containing multiple functions including logger, but server.js was importing it incorrectly, causing the server to crash on startup.

**Potential Impacts:**
- Server: Now starts correctly without TypeError
- Logging: All logging functionality now works properly

**Testing Notes:**
- Server should start without errors
- Logging output should appear in console and log files
- All API endpoints should be accessible

**Request ID:** FIX_001
