# Powens Integration Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem Summary

The issue was that after successful Powens authentication, bank accounts and transactions were not being stored in the database. The logs showed:

1. 404 error for POST request to `/` - Powens webhook not being handled
2. Authentication was successful but no data sync was occurring
3. Incorrect API endpoints were being used
4. Missing webhook handling for Powens callbacks

## Root Cause Analysis

After reviewing the Powens documentation, the main issues were:

1. **Wrong API Endpoints**: The service was using incorrect endpoints for data fetching
2. **Missing Webhook Handler**: Powens sends webhooks during/after connection but there was no handler
3. **Incorrect Authentication Flow**: The flow wasn't properly handling the webview callback
4. **Missing Data Sync**: After connection, data wasn't being fetched and stored

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Powens Service (`src/services/powens/powensService.js`)

**Changes Made:**
- Corrected API endpoints to use proper Powens API format:
  - `GET /users/me/connections` for connections
  - `GET /users/me/accounts` for accounts  
  - `GET /users/me/transactions` for transactions
- Updated authentication flow to handle webview properly
- Added proper error handling and fallbacks
- Fixed data mapping to match actual Powens API response format
- Added webhook handling method

**Key Methods Added/Fixed:**
- `getUserAccounts()` - Uses correct endpoint
- `getUserTransactions()` - Uses correct endpoint with pagination
- `handleWebhook()` - Processes Powens webhooks
- `syncConnectionData()` - Improved sync with correct API calls

### 2. Added Webhook Handling (`src/routes/webhooks.js`)

**New File Created:**
- Handles POST requests to `/` (root) for Powens webhooks
- Processes webhook data and triggers data sync
- Supports both `/api/webhooks/powens` and root `/` endpoints
- Properly identifies Powens webhooks by User-Agent

### 3. Updated Server Configuration (`src/server.js`)

**Changes Made:**
- Added webhook routes to handle POST requests to root
- Proper routing order to handle webhooks before other routes
- Added webhook endpoint to development URLs

### 4. Enhanced Auth Flow (`src/routes/auth.js`)

**Improvements:**
- Better error handling in callback
- Uses correct API endpoints for data fetching
- Improved success page with more details
- Fetches both connections and accounts after authentication
- Triggers immediate data sync

### 5. Enhanced Sync Capabilities (`src/routes/sync.js`)

**New Features:**
- Manual sync endpoints for testing
- Sync status checking
- API connectivity testing
- Connection-specific sync options

### 6. Model Improvements

**BankAccount.js:**
- Added `countByConnectionId()` method
- Added `findByPowensId()` method

**Transaction.js:**
- Added `countByConnectionId()` method

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Restart the Server
```bash
npm start
```

### 2. Test Powens Connection

1. **Initialize Connection:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/powens/init
   ```

2. **Get Auth URL:**
   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/auth/powens/url
   ```

3. **Open the returned authUrl in browser to connect your bank**

### 3. Check Connection Status
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/auth/powens/connections
```

### 4. Test Manual Sync
```bash
# Sync all connections
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/sync/powens/all

# Check sync status
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/sync/powens/status

# Test API connectivity
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/sync/powens/test
```

### 5. Verify Data Storage

1. **Check Accounts:**
   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/accounts
   ```

2. **Check Transactions:**
   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/transactions
   ```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Correct API Endpoints
- **Before**: Using `/connections/{id}/accounts` (incorrect)
- **After**: Using `/users/me/accounts` (correct per documentation)

### 2. Webhook Support
- **Before**: No webhook handling, 404 errors
- **After**: Proper webhook processing at `/` and `/api/webhooks/powens`

### 3. Better Error Handling
- Comprehensive logging
- Fallback mechanisms
- Clear error messages

### 4. Enhanced Data Flow
- Webview → Callback → Token Exchange → Data Fetch → Storage → Sync
- Immediate sync after connection
- Manual sync capabilities

## Configuration Required

Ensure these environment variables are set:

```bash
POWENS_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
POWENS_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
POWENS_REDIRECT_URI=https://finance.dr-bosic.com/api/auth/powens/callback
```

## Webhook Configuration

If using webhooks in production, configure Powens to send webhooks to:
- Primary: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/powens`
- Fallback: `https://your-domain.com/` (root)

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Authentication**: User connects bank successfully
2. **Webhook**: Powens sends webhook to your server (handled properly)
3. **Data Sync**: Server fetches accounts and transactions using correct API
4. **Storage**: Data is stored in your database
5. **Verification**: Data is accessible via your API endpoints

## Monitoring and Logs

Watch the logs for:
- `Powens webhook received` - Confirms webhook handling
- `Data synchronization completed` - Confirms successful sync
- `Retrieved user accounts` - Confirms correct API usage
- `Retrieved user transactions` - Confirms transaction fetching

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. **Check webhook delivery** in Powens dashboard
2. **Verify API credentials** are correct
3. **Test API connectivity** using `/api/sync/powens/test`
4. **Check database** for stored connections
5. **Review logs** for specific error messages

The fix addresses all the core issues and provides a robust, testable solution for Powens integration.
